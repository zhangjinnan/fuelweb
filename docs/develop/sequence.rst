Details on Cluster Provisioning & Deployment (via Facter extension)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
 .. uml::
    title Cluster Deployment
    actor WebUser

    Nailgun -> Naily: Provision,Deploy
    Naily -> Astute: Provision,Deploy
    Astute -> MC: Type of nodes?
    MC -> Astute: bootstrap
    Astute -> Cobbler: create system,reboot
    Astute -> MC: Type of nodes?

    MC --> Astute: booted in target OS
    Astute --> Naily: provisioned
    Naily --> Nailgun: provisioned
    Nailgun --> WebUser: status on UI
    Astute -> MC: Create /etc/naily.facts

    Astute -> MC: run puppet
    MC -> Puppet: runonce
    Puppet -> Puppet_master: get modules,class
    Puppet_master --> Puppet: modules, class
    Puppet -> Facter: get facts
    Facter --> Puppet: set of facts

    Puppet -> Puppet: applies $role
    Puppet --> MC: done
    MC --> Astute: deploy is done
    Astute --> Naily: deploy is done
    Naily --> Nailgun: deploy is done
    Nailgun --> WebUser: deploy is done
    
Once deploy and provisioning messages are accepted by Naily, provisioining method is called in Astute.
Provisioning part creates system in Cobbler and calls reboot over Cobbler. Then
Astute uses `MCollective direct addressing mode <http://www.devco.net/archives/2012/06/19/mcollective-direct-addressing-mode.php>`_
to check if all required nodes are available,
include puppet agent on them. If some nodes are not ready yet, Astute waits for a few seconds and does request again.
When nodes are booted in target OS,
Astute uses naily_fact MCollective plugin to post data to a special file /etc/naily.fact on target system.
Data include role and all other variables needed for deployment. Then, Astute calls puppetd MCollective plugin 
to start deployment. Puppet is started on nodes, and requests Puppet master for modules and manifests.
site.pp on Master node defines one common class for every node.
Accordingly, puppet agent starts its run. Modules contain facter extension, which runs before deployment. Extension
reads facts from /etc/naily.fact placed by mcollective, and extends Facter data with these facts, which can be
easily used in Puppet modules. Case structure in running class chooses appropriate class to import, based on $role
variable, received from /etc/naily.fact. It loads and starts to execute. All variables from file are available
like ordinary facts from Facter.

The idea is inspired by blog posts `self-classifying puppet nodes <http://nuknad.com/2011/02/11/self-classifying-puppet-nodes/>`_,
`pulling a list of hosts from mcollective for puppet <http://nuknad.com/2011/01/07/pulling-a-list-of-hosts-from-mcollective-for-puppet/>`_,
`A Simple Puppet Function to Retrieve Information From the Stored Config DB <http://blog.thesilentpenguin.com/blog/2012/02/22/a-simple-puppet-function-to-retrieve-information-from-the-stored-config-db/>`_,
`nodeless-puppet example <https://github.com/jordansissel/puppet-examples/tree/master/nodeless-puppet>`_.

It is possible to use the system without Nailgun and Naily: user creates a YAML file with all required
data, and calls Astute binary script. Script loads data from YAML and instantiates Astute instance
the same way as it's instanciated from Naily.
